Prisoner, I'll give you a chance to prove your worth to me. There are three walls which need to be broken. The only tools we have are 3 cannons and a delfector. You must break one of the walls for now with the given resources. This will please the king and give you a chance at redemption. I wish you the best but beware not to take this task lightly lest you may lose your chance to win the king's heart.
