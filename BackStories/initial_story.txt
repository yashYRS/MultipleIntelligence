Your ship crashlanded into the king's garden, and the explosion that ensued destroyed his favourite flowers. 
I can help you fix your ship, however the problem is, by the king's order you are being sent for confinement, 
and even if your ship is fixed, you won't be able to leave for PyNet. However, all hope's not lost, our king is very
eccentric. I have a few sources, who keep me updated about his mood, so that I can act accordingly and stay out of trouble. 
You seem like a good man, who's stuck here with a case for pure misfortune. From time to time I can suggest you things that you 
can do, and possibly gain favor with the man, and eventually become free, and fly off to PyNet to your family.
