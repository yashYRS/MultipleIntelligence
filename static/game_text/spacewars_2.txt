Seeing you here for so long makes me unhappy. Oh what the hell, I might as well throw you a bone. Our esteemed queen has a knack of collecting exotic flowers. At this time of the year, Elantris blooms with the purple tulips called Kelsiers. Take the spare battleships, and retrieve a couple of those flowers. Making the queen happy will go a long way into improving your situation.
